I signed up <br> for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. <br> The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing <br> the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

            student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
            did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team 
            project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers.100% recommend! ”
